# streamlit-on-azure
demonstrate  streamlit app deploy on azure

## Context
As I recently faced this question in my work, I decided did some research how to deploy streamlit in Azure

Why deploy streamlit on azure?
Streamlit has managed services with Snowflake , however it is only GA with AWS. so if you are azure user , you would need to find alternative to deploy

## Process step
Process step is referencing the step here : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1470782/how-to-deploy-a-streamlit-application-on-azure-app
update:
1. the extension pack is called "Azure Tool" now (as at 10 Jan 2024)


## Notes
1. Streamlit example code is based on this example multiple page app: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app
